				<h1>CodeDraw</h1>
				<p>
					CodeDraw is an easy-to-use drawing library where you use code to create pictures and animations.
					It is made for beginners that understand little about programming and
					makes it very simple to draw and animate various shapes and images to a canvas.
				</p>
				<p>
					The source code, documentation and further examples can be found in the
					<a href="https://github.com/Krassnig/CodeDraw">CodeDraw repository</a>.
				</p>
